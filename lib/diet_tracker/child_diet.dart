    """It's smart to start taking prenatal vitamins as soon as you know you're pregnant. In fact, many experts recommend taking them when you start trying to conceive. This is because your baby's neural tube, which becomes the brain and spinal cord, develops within the first month of pregnancy, so it's important you get essential nutrients—like folate, calcium, and iron—from the very start.

Prenatal vitamins are available over the counter at most drug stores, or you can get them by prescription from a doctor. If taking them makes you feel queasy, try taking them at night or with a light snack. Chewing gum or sucking on hard candy afterward can help, too.""",

    """Staying active is important for your general health and can help you reduce stress, improve circulation, and boost your mood. It can also encourage better sleep. Studies have shown that exercise has many benefits to support a healthy pregnancy, including helping to lower the risk of preeclampsia.

Take a pregnancy exercise class or walk at least 15 to 20 minutes a day at a moderate pace—in cool, shaded areas or indoors in order to prevent overheating.

Pilates, yoga, swimming, and walking are also great activities for most pregnant people, but be sure to check with a health care provider before starting any exercise program. Aim for 30 minutes of exercise most days of the week. Listen to your body, though, and don't overdo it.""",

Who you want present
Procedures you want to avoid
What positions you prefer for labor and delivery
Special clothing you'd like to wear
Whether you want music or a special focal point
Whether you want pain medications and what kind
What to do if complications arise""",

You'll also become more acquainted with the facility and its staff.

Now is also a good time to brush up on your family's medical history. Talk to your doctor about problems with past pregnancies, and report any family incidences of congenital disorders.""",

The best part: No one can tell you're doing them—so you can practice Kegels in the car, while you're sitting at your desk, or even standing in line at the grocery store.

Here's how to do them:

1. Practice squeezing as though you're stopping the flow of urine when you use the bathroom.
2. Hold for three seconds, then relax for three.
3. Repeat 10 times for a complete set.""",
